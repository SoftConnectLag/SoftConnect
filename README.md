# SoftConnect
Provides efficient relationship between Unilag DSA and the students

It is a Solution that is expected to Bridge the gap between UNILAG DSA and The Students, We have a dummy DSA Side which Enables the DSA Send Messages, View Sent Messages and View Users Who have Paid.. We also created a USSD Utility App, with short code as *384*22222# which enables registered students Check if they're registered and also View their Matric No.. 

We have Test Values for Matric No on the Users side as 170805028 and 170805037 and Phone Numbers as +2347016663388 and +2348167364146 respectively...

We also have admin login details as Username : admin, Password : admin123.. 

The USSD Service Should be tested on Sandbox.. Also for the bulk SMS sent by DSA to students should be tested via sandbox..
